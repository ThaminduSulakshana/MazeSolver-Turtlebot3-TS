# Turtlebot3 Maze Solver

This repository contains the implementation for the IE4060 Robotics and Intelligent Systems assignment. The robot solves a maze, detects open slits in a wall, and chooses the appropriate path based on the number of open slits.

## Features
- 1.Autonomous maze-solving algorithm.
- 2.Slit detection with decision-making logic.
- 3.Pre-programmed path following based on slit count.

## Repository Structure
- `/code`: Source code for maze navigation, slit detection, and trajectory planning.
- `/docs`: Assignment instructions and algorithm details.
- `/screenshots`: Visual references of the project.
- `/results`: Videos and logs of the robot's execution.
- `/hardware`: Documentation on hardware setup.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in `/hardware/hardware_setup.md` for configuring the robot.
3. Run the code from `/code` based on the task to be executed.
